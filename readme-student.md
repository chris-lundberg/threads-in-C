## README

# Instructions

Specifically, we will evaluate your submission based upon:

- Your project design.  Pictures are particularly helpful here.
- Your explanation of the trade-offs that you considered, the choices you made, and _why_ you made those choices.
- A description of the flow of control within your submission. Pictures are helpful here.
- How you implemented your code. This should be a high level description, not a rehash of your code.
- How you _tested_ your code.  Remember, Bonnie isn't a test suite.  Tell us about the tests you developed.
  Explain any tests you _used_ but did not develop.
- References: this should be every bit of code that you used but did not write.  If you copy code from
  one part of the project to another, we expect you to document it. If you _read_ anything that helped you
  in your work, tell us what it was.  If you referred to someone else's code, you should tell us here.
  Thus, this would include articles on Stack Overflow, any repositories you referenced on github.com, any
  books you used, any manual pages you consulted.
